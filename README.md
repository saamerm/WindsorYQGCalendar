# Windsor YQG Community and Tech Events Calendar
[Calendar of Community and Tech events for Windsor Ontario YQG](https://thefirstprototype.com/windsor-ontario-yqg-events-calendar/) to show the things to do in the city.

This web application was built with the help of [these Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/WnnGHvEo5QWPaim74PxZxO/Calendar?node-id=0%3A1) that were professionally designed using [TFP's UI/UX design services](https://thefirstprototype.com).

Frontend
As you can see, the front end is code with Vanilla HTML, CSS & JS. To understand the front-end, you can follow the Responsive Web Design and a part of the JavaScript certifications from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

Backend:
The backend is written in JS using Google Sheets! Here's the [database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1capzJ-WkHkTP-3ygHCToyhQnBPLYmVfglqEUoHPt08Q/edit#gid=1731707385) and a copy of the web service code is placed in the `Backend-GoogleAppScript` directory

To understand the backend code, you can follow [this free tutorial](https://medium.com/@prototypemakers/simplest-universal-free-game-leaderboard-with-google-sheets-5ab548db009f).
